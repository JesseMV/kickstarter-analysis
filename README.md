# Kickstarting with Excel

##Overview of Project

This project aimed to determine the effectiveness of various Kickstarter campaigns, and determine the best conditions for success.

##Analysis and Challenges

The dataset was rather expansive, but by narrowing the focus to theater campaigns that were either successful, failed, or canceled helped to give greater perspective on their outcome based on when they were launched. The most successful campaigns were launched in late spring and early summer, while the campaigns that failed or were ultimately canceled were relatively flat throughout the year.

This second set of data shows the outcomes based on the financial goal of each campaign. There seems to be more failure as the goal amount increases, save for one exception in the $35000 to $40000 price range.

##Results

Based on the data, it seems the best time to launch a campaign for theater projects is in late spring and early summer. These dates have greater success by a decent margin. Late in the year, December specifically, we see that the success and failure rate are nearly identical.

Looking at the outcomes based on goals, lower goals tend to do better. There is a significant bump in successful campaigns in the $35000 to $40000 range. A closer look at the data would be necessary to determine why there is such a dramatic bump in that range.
